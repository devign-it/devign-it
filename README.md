# ðŸŒž Resume 2019 build w/ Gatsby.js

Transition to a dynamic website with the SSR Gatsby. Learning React.js, Serverless deployments and CI. Still the old portfolio, just with new content and fire elements.

## Timeline

See current progress at [issues](https://github.com/danoszz/devign_resume/issues) page.

## Get started

- You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes NPM).
- Install Gulp using `npm install -g gulp`. This installs Gulp globally and is needed later.

### Local setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/danoszz/devign_resume && cd devign_resume && npm i
```

### Run the project

Based on the [Gatsby Contentful Starter](https://github.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter)

- Run project locally: `yarn run dev`

- Run a production build into ./public: `yarn run build`

- Removes all dependencies, scripts and data from the installation script: `yarn run cleanup-repository`
